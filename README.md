# ExcalidrawAi
Excalidraw AI is a next-gen diagramming system that combines LLMs + a custom schema engine (J2) to generate, update, and manage Excalidraw JSON without ever breaking it. Think Mermaid.js on steroids — but built for Excalidraw with full CRUD (create, update, delete) support, token efficiency, and scalability for massive diagrams (10k+ elements).
